I'm a Telecommunications Engineer and PhD researcher in **Artificial Intelligence**.  
My research focuses on security, fairness, and interpretability. I enjoy working with different types of models and constantly exploring new challenges. Although my main background is in Computer Vision, I also work with LLMs, biometric data, and other AI modalities.

I collaborate with **IBM Research** and work on challenges related to document forensics, fake content detection, and reliable deep learning systems.

Iâ€™m always open to exploring new AI topics and collaborations ðŸš€

When I'm not training models, I'm probably traveling, watching football, or climbing ðŸ˜„
